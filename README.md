### Steps to reproduce

**How to download needed data, run the code, etc.**

This template includes GitHub
[branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)
rules against the _main_ branch that: disable force-commits, forbid direct pushes,
require status checks to pass, and require a linear history.
This means that, after your initial import, you will not be able to commit directly to the _main_ branch.
Instead, commit to a new branch and make a pull request.

1. Clone this repository as a template and run `pre-commit install`. (`pip install pre-commit`).
2. Install the [Probot settings app](https://github.com/apps/settings).
3. Make a local clone of your repo, modify the files, commit, and push to _main_.
4. Add your code, commit it, and push it to a _new_ branch.
5. Make a pull request against _main_, wait for the checks to pass, and rebase the changes into _main_.
6. [Get a DOI](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) for your repo.
