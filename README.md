### üéÅ About this repository

**What‚Äôs in this repo?**

- Automatic linting of Python, Markdown, config files, etc. using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Nice default GitHub settings (just install the [Probot settings app](https://github.com/apps/settings) to your repo
- IDE hints via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) with good defaults for most languages
- [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/) and [CITATION.cff](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
- Nice gitignore, dockerignore, changelog, and other misc files
- Example/stub Conda environment file, Vagrantfile, and shields

### üìú Steps to reproduce

**How to download needed data, run the code, etc.**

1. Clone this repository as a template and run `pip install pre-commit` and `pre-commit install`.
2. Install the [Probot settings app](https://github.com/apps/settings).
3. Add to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Get a DOI](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) for your repo.
4. Make a local clone of your repo. Modify the readme, changelog, etc. Add your code/notebooks.
5. Commit and push to _main_. (If a linter fails on commit, just re-run. It just meant the linter modified a file.)

### üîí Branch protection rules

This template includes
[branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)
rules for the _main_ branch that disable force-commits, forbid direct pushes,
require status checks to pass, and require a linear history.
You can configure these rules under _Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí main_.
The typical workflow is: push changes to a new branch, make a pull request against _main_, and squash‚Äìmerge or rebase into _main_ after the status checks pass.
An _admin_-role user _can_ push directly to _main_, but non-_admin_ users (with write access) must make pull requests.
